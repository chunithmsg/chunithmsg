### Rules (Please Read Before Attempting!)

#### Attempting the qualifiers

Challengers Qualifiers can only be attempted by players with a Max Rating (as displayed in Chunithm-Net) of at most 16.50. This must be maintained until the end of the qualifiers period.

Should a participant’s Max Rating go above 16.50 before the end of the qualifiers period, their submission will be voided.

Qualifiers can only be played in Virtualand outlets only.

The qualifier songs must be played in the exact order as shown in the document (i.e. Tracks 1, 2 and 3, or Tracks 2, 3 and 4).

Please take a picture of each individual score. Each picture should clearly show:

- The Virtualand card reader.
- The QR Code on the machine (next to the Aime card reader).

Please note that the Qualifiers are done at your own expense.

#### Submission

[Submissions are done here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtahyQGjHnLUg3bprDW8Q5qRaGVToAE2rfuzYcLrq0hveXyw/viewform)

You are allowed to attempt the qualifiers as many times as you would like.

Both the play times of the songs (as displayed in Chunithm-Net) and the submission (in Google Forms) must be within the Qualifier Period.

#### Ranking

Rankings are based on the total score of all 3 songs.

In the case of a tie in the total score, the player with an earlier play time (of the final song, as displayed in Chunithm-Net) will be ranked higher.

The Top 16 ranked players will move on to the Finals.

You may view the leaderboard which will be updated daily as much as possible (Chunithm Sun Divisional Leaderboard).

#### Notes

The organisers reserve the right to disqualify any player from the challengers bracket for any reason.

## Challengers Finals

### Format

For the Challengers Division, the format of all matches (except the final match) will be an Arena System, which is similar to the 全国対戦 mode in the Japan Version of Chunithm.

### Arena System

For each match, a random Top 4 seed will be placed inside. Then, the other 3 slots will be filled by the remaining 12 players randomly. Each player will pick 1 song each, for a total of 4 songs per match.

If the same song is picked by multiple players, that song will still be played in the Match, but a random song will be picked by the Organisers as a replacement. No song will be repeated twice in the same match.

After each song has been played, points will be awarded depending on the position. Please refer to the following table below for the point system:

| Score Ranking | Points Awarded |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| 1st Place     | 4 Points       |
| 2nd Place     | 3 Points       |
| 3rd Place     | 2 Points       |
| 4th Place     | 1 Points       |

In the case of a tie (within a single song), both players will be awarded the same number of points.

At the end of the match, the total number of points will be added up. The Top 2 of each match will advance to the next round.

At the end of the final Arena round (4 players left), the Top 2 will advance to the grand finals.

### Tiebreakers

In the event of a tie where there are multiple players (among the top 3 or 4) with the same total number of points at the end of the match, the winner will be chosen using the following properties, in order:

- The higher total score of all 4 songs.
- The lower total number of (Non-Critical) Justice judgments among all 4 songs.

### Challengers Grand Finals

In the grand finals match between the Top 2, each player will select 2 songs each, for a total of 4 songs.

Just like the Arena matches, if the same song is picked by both players, that song will still be played in the Match, but a random song will be picked by the Organisers as a replacement. No song will be repeated twice in the same match.

The winner is the player with the higher total score.

#### Tiebreakers

In the event of a tie where both players have the same total score, the winner will be chosen using the following properties, in order:

- The higher number of songs won.
- The higher number of counter-picks won (i.e. songs that were not selected by the player themselves).
- The lower total number of (Non-Critical) Justice judgments among all 4 songs.

### Chart Constant Restrictions

There will be level restrictions put in place per round through the course of the tournament. Please view the following tables for more information.

| Round  | Level / Chart Constant Restrictions |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Top 16 | Level 13 and 13+                    |
| Top 8  | Level 13+ and 14                    |
| Top 4  | Level 14                            |
| Top 2  | Chart Constant 14.2 - 14.7          |

## Masters Qualifiers

### Format

The Qualifier follows a Score-Attack format where players will have to play a fixed set of songs and submit the score of their run. For the Masters Division, players will need to complete 2 sets of 3 songs each.

### Rules (Please Read Before Attempting!)

#### Attempting the qualifiers

Qualifiers can only be played in Virtualand outlets only.

For each set, the qualifier songs must be played in the exact order as shown in the document (i.e. Tracks 1, 2 and 3, or Tracks 2, 3 and 4).

Please take a picture of each individual score. Each picture should clearly show:

- The Virtualand card reader.
- The QR Code on the machine (next to the Aime card reader).

Please note that the Qualifiers are done at your own expense.

#### Submission

[Submissions are done here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtahyQGjHnLUg3bprDW8Q5qRaGVToAE2rfuzYcLrq0hveXyw/viewform)

You will need to submit the form two times - once for each set.

You are allowed to attempt the qualifiers as many times as you would like.

You are allowed to submit your scores for Set A and Set B separately, and you can submit multiple attempts for each set.

Both the play times of the songs (as displayed in Chunithm-Net) and the submission (in Google Forms) must be within the Qualifier Period.

#### Ranking

Rankings are based on the total score of all 6 songs.

In the case of a tie in the total score, the player with an earlier play time (of the latest of the 6 songs, as displayed in Chunithm-Net) will be ranked higher.

The Top 8 ranked players will move on to the Finals.

You may view the leaderboard which will be updated daily as much as possible (Chunithm Sun Divisional Leaderboard).

## Masters Finals

### Format

The Masters Division will compete in a Single-Elimination Bracket, similar to the King of Performai (KOP) system. The 1st Seed will play against the 8th Seed, 2nd Seed against the 7th Seed, 3rd Seed against the 6th Seed and the 4th Seed against the 5th Seed.

Each match will be 4 songs, 2 songs picked each by each player. If the same song is picked by both players, that song will still be played in the Match, but a random song will be picked by the Organisers as a replacement. No song will be repeated twice in the same match.

The winner of the match through total sum of score will advance to the next round.

### Tiebreakers

In the event of a tie where both players have the same total score, the winner will be chosen using the following properties, in order:

- The higher number of songs won.
- The higher number of counter-picks won (i.e. songs that were not selected by the player themselves).
- The lower total number of (Non-Critical) Justice judgments among all 4 songs.

### Cards

Each player will be given two power-up cards that they can use during the tournament.

- Each card may only be used at most once throughout the tournament.
- A player can use at most one card per round.
- No card can be used in the final (i.e. Top 2) round.

The cards are as follows:

1. Randomiser: Randomises one song chosen by your opponent to a pool of six songs according to the song's chart constant. The chosen song by the randomiser cannot be the same as the song previously chosen.
2. Limit Break: One of your song choices may be chosen with a higher chart constant, according to the section "Chart Constant Restrictions" below. In addition, this song choice may not be randomised with the "Randomiser" card above.

Hence, this is how choosing the song process will be done.

1. Everyone chooses 2 charts. Limit break can be used in one chart of your choice.
2. These charts will be passed to your opponent. If your opponent has not used limit break, your opponent may use the Randomiser card to randomise one chart of your choice. However, charts chosen with Limit Break cannot be randomised.
3. Reveal all charts.

### Chart Constant Restrictions

There will be level restrictions put in place per round through the course of the tournament. Please view the following tables for more information.

| Round | Chart Constant Restrictions | With Limit Break      |
| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Top 8 | 14.5 - 14.9 inclusive       | 14.5 - 15.2 inclusive |
| Top 4 | 14.8 - 15.2 inclusive       | 14.8 - 15.4 inclusive |
| Top 2 | 15.0 - 15.4 inclusive       | N/A                   |

### Randomiser Pool

Here are the charts that are available to be chosen with the Randomiser card.

| No. \ Chart Constant | 14.5                                                                   | 14.6                | 14.7                             | 14.8                                   | 14.9                                                | 15.0                        | 15.1                    | 15.2                   |

## FAQs

### Will the games be sponsored?

The game credits will be provided in the Finals only.

### When will the Waiting List people know whether they will be competing in the Finals?

On the day of the competition, if there are no shows, the Organiser will contact you directly. Hence, do keep that day free and remain contactable.

### What will be the proceedings of the day?

We will be sending out a schedule closer to the Finals date. However, you are highly recommended to stay in the Arcade for the duration of the Tournament.

### How will the brackets be determined?

The organiser will be drawing lots for the unseeded players beforehand. The procedures will be done live and in view of an audience.

### Are there any registration fees for the tourney?

No, there are not.

### What is the Song Pool?

We will cut off the Song Pool at Armageddon, which is the 13 April 2023 update. All games will use Master Ticket unless an Ultima is chosen, in which case an Ultima Ticket will be required.

### Is there any particular character skill needed for the Tournament?

We recommend using the Boost or Combo skill. We are not responsible if you accidentally pick a Danger or above Skill and fail out during the Tournament itself. Should a participant fail a song prematurely due to a Danger or above Skill or otherwise, we will take your fail out score as the result; this has happened before. You have been warned.

If there are any other questions that are not covered in this document, feel free to contact any of the Organisers by joining the Chunithm SG Discord (Discord Link). Please provide the relevant proof needed before being granted entry into the Discord.
