### Rules (Please Read Before Attempting!)

#### Attempting the qualifiers

Qualifiers can only be played in **Virtualand Nex**, and during the Qualifiers period (3rd-4th Feb 2024, 1200-1800). Unless special permission is granted by the Organisers, any entry that violates these conditions will be disregarded, even if the player has paid the entry fee.

Players may either walk-in or reserve a timeslot in advance (details of this process will be released soon).

The qualifier songs must be played in the exact order as shown in the document (i.e. Tracks 1, 2 and 3), and **in view of any one of the Organisers**.

Please notify any one of the Organisers, who will be physically present at the Qualifiers venue, before you begin your Qualifiers attempt. Your scores for the Qualifier songs will be recorded.

#### Ranking

Rankings are based on the total score of all 3 songs. We will take the **better of the two attempts** as the final score.

In the rare event of a tie, the player with an **earlier play time** will be ranked higher.

The Top 30 ranked players will move on to the Finals.

During the Qualifiers period, the leaderboard will be updated hourly, subject to the Organisers' availability.

#### Notes

The organisers reserve the right to disqualify any player from the competition for any reason.

## Finals

### Format

The Finals will consist of 3 rounds:

1. Score Attack Round
2. Team Matches Round
3. Grand Finals

### Score Attack Round

(The Top 6 players in the Qualifiers will **not** be involved in this round.)

In the Score Attack Round, the **7th-30th placed players** will have to play **one** song prescribed by the Organisers. This song will be randomly chosen by the Organisers from a pool of **fifteen (15) Master Lv14** songs, and will be announced on 4th February 2200hrs. Players will play the song in order of seed number.

Only the top 12 scoring players will advance to the Team Matches Round. All other players will be eliminated.

#### Song Pool

(To be announced later)

#### Tiebreakers

In the rare event of a tie where multiple players have the same score, the player with the **better seed number** will be ranked higher.

### Team Matches Round

In this round, the remaining 18 players will be split into 6 teams of 3 players each. This round will be conducted in two phases: a Team Drafting phase, and the Team Battle phase.

#### Team Drafting

In the Team Drafting Phase, the Top 6 players in the Qualifiers Round will be designated as Team Captains. In order of seed number, each Captain will draft one player of their choice (from the remaining 12 finalists), and the player will be added to their team. After all teams have 2 players each, the remaining 6 finalists will then be randomly placed into teams. Please refer to the image below for more details.

At the end of this phase, each player must belong in exactly one team.

#### Notes

- The decisions of the Team Captains are **final** and **irreversible**. Therefore, Captains are advised to carefully consider their selections.
- If any player refuses to be accepted in their team despite all mediation possible by the Organisers, the **entire team** shall be disbanded and disqualified from the Tournament.
- The Organisers reserve the right to disqualify any player and/or team from the Tournament for any reason.

#### Team Battle

Team matches will feature home and away sides. In the 1st half, each team will play against every other team once. Matches are repeated in the 2nd half but with **home/away sides switched**.

Every team match consists of 2 separate 1v1 tracks. The home team will present the song and player order, before the away team responds with their player own player order. Please refer to the image below for more information.

Each team will play a total of 10 matches, with 5 of them being on the home side. Every player must play **at least thrice in each half**.

#### Limit Break Mechanic

Each team shall be entitled to **three (3)** "Limit Break" cards. This allows teams to select songs that are outside of the standard Chart Constant restrictions.

At the end of the Team Battle phase, all unused Limit Break cards will expire.

#### Song Restrictions

The following table shows the Chart Constant restrictions for the Team Battle phase.

| Chart Constant Restrictions | With Limit Break      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 13.7 - 14.7 inclusive       | 13.0 - 14.9 inclusive |

Note that **only MASTER or ULTIMA** charts may be selected. Furthermore, teams **cannot** repeat their picks throughout the entire tournament.

#### Ranking

At the end of the Team Battle phase, teams will be ranked according to the total number of wins during the Team Matches. The top **four (4)** teams will proceed to the Grand Finals, and the remaining teams will be eliminated.

In the event of a tie in total wins, the following tiebreakers shall apply, in order of priority:

- The highest total number of wins on the "away" side.
- The highest total score difference across all team matches.

### Grand Finals

In the Grand Finals round, there will be three (3) matches, each consisting of 5 1v1 tracks.

Songs 1, 3, and 5 are decided by the higher ranked team, while song 2 and 4 by the lower ranked team (CC range **14.8-15.4**). When responding to the opponent’s picks, no repeat assigning of players is allowed.

The 3rd and 4th place teams will battle first, and the team with the **higher total score** wins. The winning team challenges the next highest placed group until one team is left. Please refer to the following infographic for more information.

The game credits will be provided in both the Qualifiers and the Finals.

### When will the Waiting List people know whether they will be competing in the Finals?

On the day of the competition, if there are no shows, the Organiser will contact you directly. Hence, do keep that day free and remain contactable.

### What will be the proceedings of the day?

We will be sending out a schedule closer to the Finals date. However, you are highly recommended to stay in the Arcade for the duration of the Tournament.

### How will the teams be determined?

The Top 6 players in the Qualifiers will be designated as Team Captains. After the Score Attack Round concludes, the remaining 12 players will then be drafted by the Team Captains. Please refer to the Team Matches section for more details.

### Are there any registration fees for the tourney?

Yes, there is a **$10 entry fee** for the Qualifiers.

### What is the Song Pool?

We will cut off the Song Pool at SUN Ep. V (夢と幻想の終点にて, Superbia, 空間創造理論, βlαnoir), which is the 21 December 2023 update. All games will use Master Ticket unless an Ultima is chosen, in which case an Ultima Ticket will be required.

### Is there any particular character skill needed for the Tournament?

We recommend using the Boost or Combo skill. We are not responsible if you accidentally pick a Danger or above Skill and fail out during the Tournament itself. Should a participant fail a song prematurely due to a Danger or above Skill or otherwise, we will take your fail out score as the result; this has happened before. You have been warned.
